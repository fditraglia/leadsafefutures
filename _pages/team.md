ECLIPS is led by Northumbria University in partnership with the UK Health Security Agency, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Bristol, University of Oxford, University of Warwick, and the Health & Safety Laboratory Executive. Our team includes experts in environmental science, health, epidemiology, and economics.

Convened under the auspices of UKHSA and reporting to the LEPHIS Steering Group, the ECLIPS working group was established in 2021. The study team has built respect and trust, and organically developed an approach that facilitates interdisciplinary working across its members, valuing, enabling and celebrating integration of the disciplines

I have a background in analytical chemistry, contaminated land investigation, and public health risk assessment. This led me to research how people are exposed to harmful chemicals like lead through their environments, food, and air. My current work includes measuring chemicals in people and homes, measuring air quality, assessing health risks and involving communities in science. I also explore how climate change might affect exposure to these chemicals.
