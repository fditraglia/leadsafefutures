## Frequently Asked Questions 

### What is Lead (Pb)?
Lead is a type of metal that occurs naturally in the earth. It can be dangerous to our health, especially if it builds up in our bodies over time. The official use of lead in paint, pipes and petrol stopped, but we can still be exposed through old paint, lead window decorations, crystall glass, solder on hot water systems and some imported foods . Because it can harm people, many countries have stopped using it or have limited its use. 

Adults and children can get lead into their bodies if they breathe in lead dust (especially during activities such as renovations, repairs, or painting that disturbs painted surfaces), if they swallow lead dust that has settled on food or food preparation surfaces, of if they eat paint chips or soil that contains lead.

Children are particularly vulnerable to lead’s effects because of their developing brains. Even low levels of lead exposure can reduce intelligence, attention span, educational achievement, and increase antisocial behaviour.

### What problem are we trying to solve?
Exposure to legacy lead (Pb) is a hidden heath burden worldwide. In 2020 [UNICEF and Pure Earth](https://www.unicef.org/reports/toxic-truth-childrens-exposure-to-lead-pollution-2020) estimated 815 million children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood, creating an estimated global social cost of childhood Pb exposure of $1.2 trillion per year. In the UK, [Pb exposure has been estimated](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30752-2/fulltext) to affect 180,000-280,000 children. Currently, doctors can order blood tests for children they suspect have high lead levels, but this approach likely misses many children with no obvious symptoms. We need to understand current levels of lead exposure to guide public health policies and reduce the societal burden.

### What are the impacts of lead on health?
Lead exposure can have serious health effects, especially on young children. Some of the impacts of lead on health include:
1.	**Brain and Nervous System Damage**: Lead can affect the development of the brain, causing learning difficulties, memory problems, and attention issues. It can also lead to behavioral problems such as irritability or hyperactivity.
2.	**Reduced IQ and Academic Performance**: Lead exposure can lower IQ levels and affect a child's ability to learn and perform well in school.
3.	**Hearing and Speech Problems**: Lead can harm the nervous system in ways that may lead to hearing loss and speech delays in children.
4.	**Kidney Damage**: Long-term exposure to lead can damage the kidneys, affecting their ability to filter waste from the body.
5.	**Anaemia**: Lead can interfere with the production of red blood cells, leading to anemia, which can cause fatigue and weakness.
6.	**Growth and Development Delays**: Children exposed to lead may experience delays in growth and physical development.
7.	**Increased Risk of High Blood Pressure**: In adults, long-term exposure to lead can increase the risk of high blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease.

Effects observed in association with acute and chronic exposure to lead also include depression, anxiety, stroke, miscarriage, pre-term birth; lung, stomach, intestine and larynx cancer; endocrine disruption,and more.

Lead poisoning is particularly dangerous to young children, who are more vulnerable to its harmful effects as their bodies and brains are still developing. Even low levels of lead exposure can be harmful.

### Why are we doing the study?
Our vision is a transformative new protocol for a child blood lead (Pb) biomonitoring study, validated through a cohort study in Leeds, unlocking a national blood Pb screening programme. A national Pb screening programme will indicate the prevalence of elevated child blood Pb concentrations (BLC) and inform public and environmental health action and policies to address the persistent, pervasive, socio-economic health inequities caused by exposure to Pb. We are particularly interested in how different methods of communication  influence families’ willingness to take part. This information will help us plan other larger studies in the future to keep more young children safe from harmful lead exposures.

Until now, blood samples for lead tests required parents and children to go to a doctors surgery or hospital clinic, where a nurse used a needle and syringe (vacutainer) to collect the sample. This can be an upsetting and time-consuming experience for everyone. There is now a quick and easy blood spot collection kit that can be done at home by the parent or carer. A tiny pin prick in the side of the finger is used to collect a few drops of blood onto a special card which is posted to the laboratory. The needle used (called a lancet) is the same as that used for the iron test at the blood donors and by diabetics testing their blood sugar levels at home.  

Our health partners (such as colleagues at Leeds Teaching Hospital) want to use this technique to make life easier for families in their lead clinics. Other members of the ECLIPS  team want to find out the blood lead concentrations in young children in Leeds so that children exposed to lead in their everyday environments can have those exposures reduced or removed to improve their health, and to help decide if UK wide blood lead screening should be carried out. If this ‘use at home’ kit works well it can be used for other screening programmes in the UK and internationally.

### How are we conducting the study?
We’re testing a new, simple-to-use device for collecting a few drops of blood from a finger-prick at home. Families can then post their samples to our laboratory for analysis. We’ll also ask participants to complete questionnaires about their child, lifestyle and environment, and to provide samples of house dust and garden soil for lead testing.

### Is there a safe amount of lead we can be exposed to?
Even the smallest amount of lead can start to cause harm health. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health [Information on lowering of the lead intervention concentrations for children and pregnant women in England](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2021-09/RCPCH%20Information%20v1.0%20%28004%29.pdf) defined "While there is no defined UK threshold for the harmful effects of lead in children a BLC of ≥0.1 μmol/L (≥2 μg/dL) to <0.24 μmol/L (<5 μg/dL) is now widely accepted as the _clinical threshold_ above which investigation should occur and a source should be identified".  
 

### What is the ECLIPS study?
ECLIPS is led by Northumbria University in partnership with the UK Health Security Agency, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Bristol, University of Oxford, University of Warwick, and the Health & Safety Laboratory. Our team includes experts in environmental science, health, epidemiology, and economics. The study is supported by  community and third-sector partners, including the Lead Exposure and Poisoning Prevention Alliance (LEAPP) and a Community Advisory Group made up of local volunteers. The research team is working closely with these partners to engage the community, gather data, and share findings to improve lead exposure assessments and interventions.

### What are the common sources of Lead in the home?
Common sources of lead in the home include lead-based paints, dust, old plumbing, and soil.

### What are the common sources of Lead in the environment?
Common sources of lead in the home include:

1.	**Lead-based Paint**: Older homes (especially those built before 1980's) may have lead-based paint on walls, windows, and doors. This paint can chip, peel, or create dust, which can be harmful if ingested or inhaled.
2.	**Soil**: Lead has contaminated soil in urban areas and close to mines, especially near old houses where lead-based paints were used or close to busy roads. Thus, lead can contaminate soil, especially in areas near old houses or roads where lead-based paints were used or leaded gasoline was once common. Children playing in soil or gardens can be exposed to lead.
3.	**Plumbing**: Pipes, taps, and plumbing fixtures in older homes may contain lead, which can leach into drinking water. However, lead can still be commonly found, up to 8%, in new taps and fittings. 
4.	**Household Dust**: Lead dust can form when lead-painted surfaces deteriorate or during renovation activities. It can settle on floors, furniture, and toys, where young children may be exposed.
5.	**Imported Toys and Household Items**: Old toys, jewellery, or items from other countries may contain lead-based materials, especially if they're made with lead-based paint or other lead-containing products.
6.	**Home Renovations and DIY**: If not done safely, home renovations in older houses can disturb lead-based or lead-rich paint or dust, putting residents at risk.

Being aware of these potential sources can help reduce the risk of lead exposure in the home.

### Where is the study taking place? Why Leeds?
We're conducting our feasibility study in Leeds. The findings will help us develop methods that could be rolled out nationally.

Leeds was chosen because it is a diverse city with different income levels, job types, and backgrounds. Leeds healthcare is leading the way in lead awareness by alerting GPs and/or other clinical care providers to request a blood lead test when a blood sample is taken to test for iron levels.

### Can people sign up to take part?
At the moment people can only take part in the study if they receive an invitation letter in the post. There may be an opportunity to sign up at either a Lead Safe roadshow event, at a community Gala or via our website.  


### When will participants find out their results?
All families will receive their child's blood lead results. Study participants will receive their results within two months of submitting their blood spot samples.  

### How will I know if my child has been exposed to lead?
The most reliable way to determine lead exposure is through a blood test, which is what our study is aiming to make easier and more accessible. 

### What happens if you find a high blood lead level in my child?
If high blood lead levels are found, participants will be informed quickly, and clinicians will provide guidance on possible interventions to reduce exposure.

### What will happen with the results of this study?
The research team will share findings with health agencies, policymakers, health professionals, and the general public. The results will help agencies decide whether to rill out the studye to other areas of the UK and inform the UK Lead Exposure in Children Surveillance System (LEICSS). The results will also inform nationa cost-benefit analysis for lead intervention. 

### Will this study lead to a national screening programme?
That's our vision. This study will help us develop and test the methods needed for a national childhood lead screening programme and a national prevalence study. Our findings will inform future policy decisions about widespread monitoring of lead in children's blood.

### What makes this study different from current approaches?
We're developing a home-based blood sampling method that is easy, quick and stress-free for families. This approach could significantly increase participation in lead screening programmes and provide a more accurate picture of childhood lead exposure across different communities.

### How can this research benefit other health initiatives?
The methods we're developing could also be used for other pollutants and diseases that are diagnosed by blood samples. This could reduce the need for stressful needle blood sampling and hospital visits for many conditions.

### How will this research benefit children?
Lead exposure is preventable. By developing effective screening methods, we can help identify children at risk and develop policies to reduce children's contact with lead at home and in communities. This will enable children to develop to their full potential without the harmful effects of lead exposure.

### Who is funding this research?
This research is funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) through a grant to Northumbria University and our research partners.
