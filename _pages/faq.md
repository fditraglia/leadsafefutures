## Frequently Asked Questions 

### What is the ECLIPS study?
ECLIPS (Elevated Childhood Lead Interagency Prevalence Study) is a research project developing and testing new methods for monitoring lead levels in children's blood. We're working to create an effective approach that could be used for a national childhood lead screening programme in the UK.

### Who is running the study?
ECLIPS is led by Northumbria University in partnership with the UK Health Security Agency, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Bristol, University of Oxford, University of Warwick, and the Health & Safety Laboratory. Our team includes experts in environmental science, health, epidemiology, and economics.

### Why is lead exposure important?
Lead is toxic even in small amounts. It remains common in our environment due to past use in paint, petrol and plumbing, contaminating our air, water, soil, dust and food. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead's effects because of their developing brains. Even low levels of lead exposure can reduce intelligence, attention span, educational achievement, and increase antisocial behaviour.

### What problem are you trying to solve?
In the UK, lead exposure costs society approximately Â£6.8 billion per year and could affect thousands of children. Currently, doctors can order blood tests for children they suspect have high lead levels, but this approach likely misses many children with no obvious symptoms. We need to understand current levels of lead exposure to guide public health policies and reduce the societal burden.

### How are you conducting the study?
We're testing a new, simple-to-use device for collecting a few drops of blood from a finger-prick at home. Families can then post their samples to our laboratory for analysis. We'll also ask participants to complete questionnaires about their child, lifestyle and environment, and to provide samples of house dust and garden soil for lead testing.

### Where is the study taking place?
We're conducting our feasibility study in Leeds. The findings will help us develop methods that could be rolled out nationally.

### Will participants find out their results?
Yes, all families will receive their child's blood lead results, along with a thank you voucher for participating.

### How will this research benefit children?
Lead exposure is preventable. By developing effective screening methods, we can help identify children at risk and develop policies to reduce children's contact with lead at home and in communities. This will enable children to develop to their full potential without the harmful effects of lead exposure.

### How will I know if my child has been exposed to lead?
The most reliable way to determine lead exposure is through a blood test, which is what our study is aiming to make easier and more accessible. Sources of lead in homes can include old paint, soil, dust, water pipes, and certain consumer products.

### Will this study lead to a national screening programme?
That's our vision. This study will help us develop and test the methods needed for a national childhood lead screening programme. Our findings will inform future policy decisions about widespread monitoring of lead in children's blood.

### What makes this study different from current approaches?
We're developing a home-based blood sampling method that is easy, quick and stress-free for families. This approach could significantly increase participation in lead screening programmes and provide a more accurate picture of childhood lead exposure across different communities.

### How can this research benefit other health initiatives?
The methods we're developing could also be used for other pollutants and diseases that are diagnosed by blood samples. This could reduce the need for stressful needle blood sampling and hospital visits for many conditions.

### Who is funding this research?
This research is funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) through a grant to Northumbria University and our partners.
