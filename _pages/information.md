## Lead Exposure Information

### What is lead?
Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth's crust. It has been widely used in many products due to its properties, including in paint, petrol (gasoline), plumbing, and batteries. Although many of these uses have now been restricted, lead remains in our environment.

### Why is lead harmful?
Lead is toxic to humans, and particularly dangerous for children. It can damage the brain and nervous system, slow growth and development, cause learning and behaviour problems, and lead to hearing and speech problems. Even small amounts of lead in the body can cause serious and irreversible health problems.

### How are children exposed to lead?
Children can be exposed to lead through:
- Deteriorating lead-based paint in older homes (pre-1970s)
- Lead contaminated soil, especially in gardens and play areas
- Dust from home renovations or deteriorating paint
- Lead in water pipes or soldering
- Some toys, jewellery, and other consumer products
- Traditional remedies and cosmetics
- Lead brought home on work clothes from certain occupations

Young children are at higher risk because they often put their hands and objects in their mouths, and their growing bodies absorb more lead.

### What are the symptoms of lead exposure?
The tricky thing about lead exposure is that it often causes no obvious symptoms, especially at lower levels. This is why testing is so important. When symptoms do occur, they can include:

- Developmental delays
- Learning difficulties
- Irritability
- Loss of appetite
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
- Abdominal pain
- Vomiting
- Constipation
- Hearing loss

### How much lead is too much?
There is no known safe level of lead exposure. Even small amounts can harm children's health and development. In the UK, public health action is recommended when a child's blood lead level is 5 micrograms per decilitre (5 Î¼g/dL) or higher, but harmful effects can occur at lower levels too.

### How can I reduce lead exposure in my home?

#### If you live in an older home:
- Keep painted surfaces in good condition to prevent paint from peeling
- Clean floors, window sills and other surfaces regularly with a wet mop or cloth
- Wash children's hands, bottles, dummies, and toys frequently
- Remove shoes before entering the house
- If renovating, use lead-safe practices or hire specialists

#### For all homes:
- Run cold water taps for a minute before using water for drinking or cooking, especially after periods of non-use
- Use only cold water for drinking, cooking and making baby formula
- Regularly check product recalls for items containing lead
- Ensure good nutrition with adequate calcium, iron and vitamin C, which can help reduce lead absorption

### How can I find out if my child has been exposed?
The only reliable way to determine lead exposure is through a blood test. If you're concerned about your child's exposure, speak to your GP or health visitor. They can provide advice and arrange testing if necessary.

### What happens if my child has elevated lead levels?
If testing shows elevated lead levels, healthcare professionals will work with you to:
- Identify and remove the source of exposure
- Monitor your child's blood lead levels
- Provide appropriate medical treatment if necessary
- Connect you with additional resources and support

### Why is this issue important in the UK?
Although leaded petrol was banned in 2000 and lead in paint has been restricted since the 1970s, many UK homes built before 1970 may still have lead-based paint or lead water pipes. Lead can also be found in soil around homes, especially in industrial areas or near busy roads where leaded petrol was once used.


### Background Documents

#### Should we still worry about lead?

A report was written for the Royal Society of Chemistry that provides a background on lead exposure and toxicity.

#### The lead landscape in the UK

This Powerpoint presentation, with voiceover, prepared for the [Lead & Healthy Housing Conference](https://leappalliance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LHHC-conference-d0.3.pptx) in the USA explains the sources of lead exposure in the UK and describes the related regulations.
