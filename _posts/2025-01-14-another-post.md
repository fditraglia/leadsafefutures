Stay tuned! We will be developing a series of newsletters updating the progress of our project. These will include:

1. Production of project materials in different languages
2. Development of a "Be Lead Aware" leaflet to help prevent exposure to lead in home environments.
3. Developing a child-friendly approach to lead biomonitoring and household prevention.
